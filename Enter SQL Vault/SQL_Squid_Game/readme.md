# SQL Squid Game
## 9 Levels. 1 Data Science Job. Your life on the line ðŸ”«.

## Introduction
Welcome to SQL Squid Game â€“ a free educational game that's inspired by Netflix's Squid Game, SQL Murder Mystery, and a few other SQL Games we love to play.

You've just been hired as a Data Scientist by the mysterious Squid Game organization. The Front Man who runs the Squid Games promised you a fully remote job where you'll unlock cross-functional synergies with Generative AI. But in typical data industry fashion, you've been bait-and-switched. Turns out that the role is more about Product Analytics in SQL, and the job's not fully remote, it's hybrid: 5 days in office required, with 2 days optionally remote.

Before you can even complain on r/DataScience about the gig, the Front Man puts a gun to your head and starts demanding answers to various business questions. You must write SQL queries to answer him â€“ or else.
