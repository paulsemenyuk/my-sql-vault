# Squid Game Data Analysis: Tug of War Team Breakdown

## Scenario
Impressive work on the honeycomb analysis!
You’re proving to be quite the SQL mastermind—three challenges in, and not a single ethical qualm in sight. We appreciate employees who embrace our... *unique corporate culture.* It’s like a family, you know?

Now, it’s time to get serious about **team dynamics**. The **Tug of War** game is next on the schedule, and The Front Man has a special request.

He’s particularly interested in the **demographic advantages** certain teams might have. **Age** does bring wisdom, but **youth** has its merits too, wouldn’t you say?

## Your Next Challenge

### Task:
The Front Man needs to **analyze and rank** the teams before the **Tug of War** game starts. Specifically:

1. **Filter** to teams that have **exactly 10 players**.
2. **Calculate** each of these teams’ **average player age**.
3. **Categorize** teams into three **age groups** based on their average player age:
   - **'Fit'**: Average age **< 40**
   - **'Grizzled'**: Average age **between 40 and 50** (inclusive)
   - **'Elderly'**: Average age **> 50**
4. **Rank** the teams **by their average age**, with **highest average age = rank 1**.

### Required Output:
Display for each valid team:
- **team_id**
- **average_age**
- **age_group** (using the categories above)
- **rank** (1 for highest average age, 2 for second highest, etc.)
