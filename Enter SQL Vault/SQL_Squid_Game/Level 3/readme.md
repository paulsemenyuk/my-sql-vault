# Squid Game Data Analysis: Honeycomb Game & Temperature Influence

## Scenario

Well, well! Look who's becoming quite the **asset** to our organization. Your resource optimization skills were *chef's kiss*—absolutely delightful! The resulting **chaos** in the dormitory over the limited rations was quite the entertainment for our VIPs.

Now, let's move on to another of our classic challenges: the **Honeycomb** game. There's something darkly mesmerizing about watching players take this childhood game so seriously, especially under intense conditions.

Our **meteorology department** has been meticulously **tracking temperature data** alongside player performance for decades. You see, we're not *just* sadistic—I mean, *selective*—in our game design. There's actual *science* behind our methods! The organization wants to **optimize difficulty levels** based on seasonal variations. We noticed that many players try melting the cookie during **hotter** months. That's not very fair to our **winter** contestants, is it?

## Your Next Task

**Analyze the average completion times for each honeycomb shape** during the **hottest** and **coldest** months, using **data from the past 20 years only**. Order your results by **average completion time**.

1. Use **temperature data** to identify the **hottest and coldest months**.
2. Filter to **only** the last **20 years** of data (from the current date or a specified baseline).
3. Calculate the **average time** to complete each **honeycomb shape** under those hottest and coldest month conditions.
4. **Order** the results by **average completion time** (ascending or descending, whichever your instructions specify—but presumably ascending).

## Instructions
- **Review** the provided schema for tables such as `honeycomb_records`, `temperature_logs`, etc.
- **Write a query** or series of queries to join the **honeycomb** performance data with the **temperature** data.
- Ensure you only consider data within the **past 20 years**.
- Identify which months qualify as **hottest** vs. **coldest** (details in the schema or derived from the temperature logs).
- **Compute** the **average completion times** for each shape during those months.
- **Sort** your final output by the calculated average times.

> **No solution** is provided here—use your **SQL knowledge** and the schema details to craft the query. May your analysis be as **sharp** as the honeycomb edges!
